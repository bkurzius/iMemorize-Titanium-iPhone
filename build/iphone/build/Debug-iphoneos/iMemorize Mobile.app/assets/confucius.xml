	<text><![CDATA[To show forbearance and gentleness in teaching others; and not to revenge unreasonable conduct â€” this is the energy of southern regions, and the good man makes it his study. To lie under arms; and meet death without regret â€” this is the energy of northern regions, and the forceful make it their study. Therefore, the superior man cultivates a friendly harmony, without being weak â€” How firm is he in his energy!]]></text>

Thus it is that, were the superior man to speak of his way in all its greatness, nothing in the world would be found able to embrace it, and were he to speak of it in its minuteness, nothing in the world would be found able to split it.]]></text>

	<text><![CDATA[Sincerity is the way of Heaven. The attainment of sincerity is the way of men. He who possesses sincerity is he who, without an effort, hits what is right, and apprehends, without the exercise of thought â€” he is the sage who naturally and easily embodies the right way. He who attains to sincerity is he who chooses what is good, and firmly holds it fast. To this attainment there are requisite the extensive study of what is good, accurate inquiry about it, careful reflection on it, the clear discrimination of it, and the earnest practice of it.]]></text>

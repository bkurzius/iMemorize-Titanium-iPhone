	<text><![CDATA[Many of the ideas I have explained on this last subject require a great deal of thought.  If you agree, some other time we can discuss this matter in more depth.  For that discussion, I will bring a few passages from Bahá’u’lláh’s Book of the Covenant as well as the Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Bahá so we can read them together.  But let me go on and present to you a few other ideas you will want to know about the Bahá’í Faith right from the beginning.]]></text>

Some of these laws and commandments are eternal, others changes as humanity progresses and evolves.

	<text><![CDATA[A most important aspect of every religion is the laws that the Manifestation brings to humanity in order to guide it in the right path.  Some of these laws and commandments are eternal, others changes as humanity progresses and evolves.  In the Faith we are taught that we should not think of Bahá’í laws as a series of do’s and don’ts.  Bahá’u’lláh tells us that His laws are "...the lamps of My loving providence among My servants, and the keys of My mercy for My creatures." (Bahá'u'lláh, The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, p. 22) Nor should we obey these laws out of fear of punishment, for He clearly has stated in His Most Holy Book:  “Observe My commandments, for the love of My beauty."(Bahá'u'lláh, The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, p. 22)]]></text>

	<text><![CDATA[These ideas will become clearer if I give you a few examples of Bahá’í laws.  In the physical world, human beings have to eat every day.  This is a requirement of the human body; if we don’t, we will get sick and quickly die.  We can say, then, that eating daily is a law of physical existence which has to be obeyed.  In the same way one of the commandments of Bahá’u’lláh is that we should pray every day.  Like our body, our soul needs constant nourishment, and prayer provides the nourishment for our spiritual growth.  There are many beautiful prayers revealed by the Báb, By Bahá’u’lláh and by 'Abdu'l-Bahá which we can say when we are alone or recite in meetings.  Some of these prayers are special, and some are obligatory.  One obligatory prayer is recited by Bahá’ís every day sometime between noon and sunset.  It says:]]></text>

	<text><![CDATA[In another commandment, Bahá’u’lláh prohibits backbiting and calumny.  This is important because, if you think about it, one of the greatest enemies of unity is backbiting.  And unfortunately, it has become an established practice among most of humanity to talk about other people’s faults in their absence.  Everybody seems to be concerned with everybody else’s shortcomings, which are made bigger and bigger as they are constantly mentioned.  'Abdu'l-Bahá tells us to do just the opposite.  If we see ten good qualities in someone and one fault, we should concentrate on the ten, and even if a person has ten faults and only one good quality we should focus on that one quality.]]></text>

	<text><![CDATA[O Companion of My Throne!  Hear no evil, and see no evil, abase not thyself, neither sigh and weep.  Speak no evil, that thou mayest not hear it spoken unto thee, and magnify not the faults of others that thine own faults may not appear great; and wish not the abasement of anyone, that thine own abasement be not exposed.  Live then the days of thy life, that are less than a fleeting moment, with thy mind stainless, thy heart unsullied, thy thoughts pure, and thy nature sanctified, so that, free and content, thou mayest put away this mortal frame, and repair unto the mystic paradise and abide in the eternal kingdom forevermore.]]></text>

	<text><![CDATA[Although this does not affect us much at our age, you should also know that Bahá’u’lláh prohibits the drinking of alcohol and, of course, substance abuse.  Drinking alcohol is really one of the greatest social ills that exists today in the world.  It is one of the most common causes of violence and the ruin of healthy family life.  To tell you the truth, I have never understood why people would take something that interferes with their minds and makes them lose their ability to think clearly.  Drinking makes people capable of acting in shameful ways, when we have actually been created noble.  I know a beautiful quote from Bahá’u’lláh’s Writings about nobility:]]></text>

	<text><![CDATA[O Son of Spirit!  I created thee rich, why dost thou bring thyself down to poverty? Noble I made thee, wherewith dost thou abase thyself?  Out of the essence of knowledge I gave thee being, why seekest thou enlightenment from anyone beside Me?  Out of the clay of love I molded thee, how dost thou busy thyself with another? Turn thy sight unto thyself, that thou mayest find Me standing within thee, mighty, powerful and self-subsisting.]]></text>

	<text><![CDATA[Another commandment of Bahá’u’lláh, which is one of my favorites, is about the obligation of parents and society to educate children.  Here, I have in my notebook a short passage from 'Abdu'l-Bahá’s Writings that explains this well:]]></text>

	<text><![CDATA[Therefore, the beloved of God and the maid-servants of the Merciful must train their children with life and heart and teach them in the school of virtue and perfection.  They must not be lax in this matter; they must not be inefficient.  Truly, if a babe did not live at all it were better than to let it grow ignorant, for that innocent babe, in later life, would become afflicted with innumerable defects, responsible to and questioned by God, reproached and rejected by the people.  What a sin this would be and what an omission!    The first duty of the beloved of God and the maid-servants of the Merciful is this: They must strive by all possible means to educate both sexes, male and female; girls like boys; there is no difference whatsoever between them.  The ignorance of both is blameworthy, and negligence in both cases is reprovable.  'Are they who know and they who do not know equal?']]></text>

So I hold a Bahá’í children’s class with a friend once every week and we have seventeen students.  I would love to invite you to come and help us with our class. Do you have time this Saturday afternoon?]]></text>
